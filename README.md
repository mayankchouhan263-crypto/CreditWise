# CreditWise — AI-Powered Loan Intelligence System

CreditWise is a full-stack Django web application that integrates Machine Learning to automate loan approval decisions. The system analyzes applicant financial details and predicts whether a loan application should be Approved or Rejected, along with the probability of approval.

The prediction engine uses a Logistic Regression model trained on 975,000+ realistic Indian financial records, enabling data-driven decision making similar to real banking risk assessment systems.

## Features

- **Loan Approval Predictor** — Enter your financial profile and get real-time approval probability with animated visual feedback
- **Key Factor Analysis** — See how your credit score, DTI ratio, collateral, and existing loans affect your chances
- **Improvement Tips** — Personalized suggestions to improve approval odds
- **EMI Calculator** — Calculate monthly EMI with three interest methods: Reducing Balance, Flat Rate, and Compound Interest
- **Amortization Schedule** — Year-by-year repayment breakdown with donut chart visualization
- **DTI Auto-Calculator** — Automatically calculates your Debt-to-Income ratio from monthly income and debt inputs

## Retraining the Model

If you want to retrain with new data:

```bash
# Step 1 — Run the preprocessing notebook
# Open ML/data_Preprocessing.ipynb and run all cells
# This generates ML/Data/Processed_loan_approval_data.csv

# Step 2 — Train the model
python "ML/Train and Test Model/final_model.py"

# Step 3 — Restart the server
cd web
python manage.py runserver
```
